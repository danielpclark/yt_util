# Youtube Utility

General purpose toolbox for working with Youtube.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yt_util'
```

## Usage

Usage notes will come in time.  Feel free to look at the source code as it's rather short.

## NOTE
> Any scraping features can break at anytime if Youtube chooses to change their page layout.

## Contribute

This project will become more and more complete over time.  Eventually the mapping of scraped data
will be implemented intelligently instead of statically.  This way when Youtube changes their site
the code will compensate for the change.  Feel free to contribute with this in mind.
